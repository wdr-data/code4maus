# Code4Maus FAQ

## initial setup

If you're setting this up for the first time `á»³arn start` will throw an arrow because it can't find the assets.

You need aws credentials to do
`aws configure`
do `export AWS_PROFILE=hackingstudio`
and then
`yarn assets:download`

 If this is done, you can run your project locally with:

`yarn start`


You have to set up an [.env](.env) file with aws credentials and then
do
`yarn assets:download`
